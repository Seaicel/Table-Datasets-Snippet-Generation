An auditory electrophysiological study was conducted to explore the influence of language experience on the saliency of dimensions underlying cortical pitch processing.
Mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to Mandarin tones were recorded in Chinese and English participants (n=10 per group) using a passive oddball paradigm. Stimuli consisted of three tones (T1: high level; T2: high rising; T3: low falling-rising). There were three oddball conditions (standard/deviant): T1/T2, T1/T3, T2/T3. In the T1/T2 and T1/T3 conditions, each tonal pair represented a contrast between a level and a contour tone; the T2/T3 condition, a contrast between two contour tones. Twenty dissimilarity matrices were created using the MMN mean amplitude measured from the Fz location for each condition per participant, and analyzed by an individual differences multidimensional scaling model.
Two pitch dimensions were revealed, interpretively labeled as 'height' and 'contour'. The latter was found to be more important for Chinese than English subjects. Using individual weights on the contour dimension, a discriminant function showed that 17 out of 20 participants were correctly classified into their respective language groups.
The MMN can serve as an index of pitch features that are differentially weighted depending on a listener's experience with lexical tones and their acoustic correlates within a particular tone space.

Establishing the correct alcohol use disorder diagnosis is clinically relevant because several reports of post-transplant alcohol use suggest that a pre-transplant diagnosis of alcohol dependence (rather than abuse) predicts relapse to alcohol use. Numerous combinations of specific symptoms are possible to achieve diagnostic significance.
The authors hypothesized that there would be distinct clusters of liver transplant recipients who showed specific combinations of alcohol-related symptoms and that these clusters would be predictive of alcohol-abuse outcome after transplant.
A group of 120 ALD liver transplant recipients received the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) module for alcohol abuse/dependence, and a cluster analysis was performed.
Within the clusters of those with alcohol dependence, cluster assignment did not predict those more likely to drink. However, those assigned to the alcohol abuse cluster were significantly less likely to drink than those with alcohol dependence.
Results therefore suggest that the prognosis regarding continued abstinence posttransplant is much more positive for individuals with a diagnosis of abuse than for those who meet criteria for alcohol dependence.

Minimally invasive methods of predicting the risk of muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma may expedite appropriate therapy and reduce morbidity and cost.
Here, capillary electrophoresis coupled mass spectrometry was used to identify urinary polypeptide bladder cancer biomarkers in 127 patients. These markers were used to construct a panel discriminating muscle-invasive from noninvasive disease, which was refined in 297 additional samples from healthy volunteers, patients with malignant and nonmalignant genitourinary conditions. Sequencing of panel polypeptides was then done. Finally, the ability of the panel to predict muscle-invasive disease was evaluated prospectively in 130 bladder carcinoma patients. Four sequenced polypeptides formed a panel predictive of muscle-invasive disease.
Prospective evaluation of this panel revealed a sensitivity of 81% [95% confidence interval (CI), 69-90] and specificity of 57% (95% CI, 45-69) for muscle-invasive disease. Multivariate analysis revealed the panel (P < 0.0001) and tumor grade (P = 0.0001), but not urine cytology, predict muscle invasion. A model including grade and panel polypeptide levels improved sensitivity [92% (95% CI, 82-97)] and specificity [68% (95% CI, 55-79)] for muscle-invasive disease. A model score of >0.88 provided a negative predictive value of 77% and positive predictive value of 90% for muscle invasion.
Use of urinary peptides seems promising in estimating the probability a patient harbors muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer. These peptides may also shed novel insights into the biology of bladder tumor progression not obtainable by other methods. Clinical trials seem warranted to evaluate the effect of this approach on practice.

The aims of this study were to: (i) assess gender differences of objective sleep patterns in a general population sample; (ii) evaluate the effects of menopause and hormone treatment (HT) on the sleep of the same cohort; and (iii) examine gender differences in sleep resilience towards external stressors. The participants were (i) 1324 subjects without sleep complaints, recruited from the general population of Central Pennsylvania that spent one night in the sleep laboratory and (ii) 66 young, healthy volunteers whose sleep was disturbed during night four by an external stressor, i.e. 24-h blood drawing (average of nights 2 and 3 versus night 4). Women compared with men in the general population sample had significantly higher percentage of sleep time, lower percentage of stage 1, and higher percentage of slow wave sleep. Also, menopause, in the absence of HT, was associated with prolonged sleep latency and decreased deep sleep. Finally, young, healthy women compared with men experienced less sleep disturbance because of blood draws as indicated by a significantly smaller change in per cent sleep time, and percentage of stage 1 sleep. These findings suggest that women without sleep complaints sleep objectively better across age than men and the sleep of young women is more resistant to external stressors. Also, gonadal hormones exert a beneficial effect on women's sleep. This gender dimorphism in sleep regulation may have been to protect women from the demands of infant and child care, and in part, might contribute to women's lower cardiovascular risks and greater longevity.

La Communaute des Soeurs de Charite de la Providence and others [1903 UKPC 17] The action out of which this Appeal has arisen was commenced on 29 November 1899 by the Appellants, Ambrose L. Kent and two others, in their character 9qualite) of Liquidators of the Bank Ville-Marie, against the Respondents, La Communaute des Saus de Respondents, La Communute des Soeurs de Charite de la Providence, to recover the sum of $20,000 alleged to be owing by the Respondents to the Bank on a promissory note. The Bank Ville-Marie was and is a corporation having power to sue, and it formerly carried on business in Montreal and other places, but on business in Montreal and other places, but on 10 August 1899 the Bank was ordered to be wound up under the provisions of the Canadian Winding-up Act of 1886 (Revised Statutes of Canda, c. 129), and the Appellants were duly appointed the Liquidators thereof.

There are on this land three natural springs of mineral waters containing chemical properties which render them serviceable as table water and for medicinal purposes. The springs are in close proximity to each other, but differ widely in their character. [Horace_Davey,_Baron_Davey|Lord Davey] Sustained [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] The Algoma Central Railway Company v. The King [1903 UKPC 54] In this case their Lordships think it is sufficient to express their concurrence in the Judgments of the learned Judges of the Suoreme Court of Canada to which, in their opinion, it is not possible usefully to add anything. A foreign-built ship was bought by the Appellant Company in the United States, and brought to Canada. An application was made for registration. When that application was made duty was claimed on the ship as coming under the head of \"goods\" imported into Canada. It is difficult to see on what ground that claim could be resisted.In this case their Lordships think it is sufficient to express their concurrence in the Judgments of the learned Judges of the Suoreme Court of Canada to which, in their opinion, it is not possible usefully to add anything.

The Consumers Cordage Company [1903 UKPC 57] The result of the course which this litigation has pursued is, that their Lordships are asked to give an opinion upon a question of fact which has never been litigated in the Court below, and upon a question of law which has never been argued there. With reference to the question of law their Lordships would, of course, be prepared to give their opinion, if the facts upon which that pinion was to be given were actually ascertained. But so much appears to depend upon the exact form of the alleged illegality, which may turn out to be only an offence against a particular law, that their Lordships regard it as more prudent not to enter into the question of law, and the distinctions arising from the law prevailing in the part of the Empire in question, until the facts have been actually ascertained. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The Attorney General for the Province v. Ostrum [1903 UKPC 71] This appeal turns on the meaning of the expressing \"income\" in the Assessment Act, Chap. 179 of the Revised Statues of British Columbia, 1897. The Act contains no definition of the word. But it explains \"personal property\" as comprehending, among other things, \"all income,\" and it declares that \"all land and personal property and income in \"the Province shall be liable to taxation,\" subject to certain exemptions, including the exemption of \"the income of every person up \"to one thousand dollars.\" [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Overturned [British_Columbia_Court_of_Appeal|British Columbia Supreme Court] The Trust Loan Company of Canada v.

The Respondent Dame Hermine Labrice de Kerouack is the wife of M. Corriveau, but she is entitled to separate property. Such property consists of land in the town and district of Obervile. M. and Madame Corriveau, although duly separated as to property, lived together, and he managed her property. Considerable sums of money had been laid out upon it before 1897, and in particular some stables and billiard room had been built.

The Dominion Elevator Company Limited [1904 UKPC 54] Their Lordships think that this is not the case in which they can advise His Majesty to exercise Her Prerogative. It is not for their Lordships to say whether they would or would not, have drawn the same inferences of fact as were drawn in the Supreme Court. The Petitioners seek to appeal from the adverse decision of the Supreme Court-invoked, it may be added, by themselves because they were the Appellants to the Supreme Court. They come here, therefore, to ask for special leave to appeal, and the conditions under which such a leave can alone be granted are now very well known to gentlemen practising at the Bar, or ought to be. They would have to make out that there was a question of law of such great and general importance as would justify their Lordships in advising the exercise of the Prerogative. So far their Lordships can make out, no question of law at all arises here. The learned Counsel for the Petitioners was asked to state the question of law, and he did not succeed in satisfying their Lordships that there was any question of law in the case. [Horace_Davey,_Baron_Davey|Lord Davey] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The Kingston Light Heat and Power Company v. The Corporation of the City of Kingston [1904 UKPC 17] Their Lordships entertain no doubt at all that the questions raised by this Appeal have been rightly decided by the learned Judges in Ontario. It appears to their Lordships, as it did to the Courts below, that the terms of the Agreement of 14 July 1896 are conclusive against the Appellants\u2019 claim to receive compensation for the franchise and goodwill. The general word \"property\", on which the Appellants\u2019 argument turns\u2019 is limited, as are the other substantives with which it is coupled, viz., \"works\", \"plant\", and \"appliances\", by the words which follow, \"used for light, heat, and power purposed.\" It is impossible to suppose that the ideas of franchise and goodwill are meant to be included in this description, which is one of physical objects.

There is another question whether the matter is res judicata between the parties. [Horace_Davey,_Baron_Davey|Lord Davey] Overturned [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] The Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. The Corporation of the City of Toronto [1904 UKPC 73] This is an Appeal from a unanimous Judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario confirming, except in one particular, a previous Judgment of Chancellor Boyd. The principal question between the parties is, whether a lease from the Corporation of the City of Toronto to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company ought to contain a covenant by the latter for the payment of taxes. There are two other questions, viz., at what date the payment of rent should commence, and whether interest is payable on arrears of rent, and, if so, from what date.

The Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada [1904 UKPC 63] The question raised by this Appeal is whether the certain swamp lands were vested in the Province of Manitoba on the passing of a Canada Statute in 1885, or whether they only came to be vested in that Province on certain later dates when the swamp lands were in fact transferred. There are no disputed facts; the proceedings consequent on the Statute are simple; and the controversy is on the construction of the Statute. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company and another v. The King [1904 UKPC 64] The Calgary Edmonton Railway Company was incorporated in April 1890 by a Dominion Act for the purpose of making and working a railway from Calgary to Edmonton with an extension southerly to the boundary between Canada and the United State and northerly to the Peace River. Shortly after its incorporation the Company applied to the Minister of the Interior for a grant of Dominion lands in aid of the construction of the line, and by an Order in Council dated 5 May 1890, the Governor-General sanctioned a recommendation by the Minister that, subject to the approval of Parliament, a grant of Dominion lands should be made to the Company at the usual rate of 6,400 acres per mile of the line from Calgary to Edmonton and from Calgary southerly to the international boundary, but subject to certain conditions which it is unnecessary to refer to. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Hanson and another v. The Corporation of the Village of Grand Mere [1904 UKPC 62] The Appellants are holders of a debenture for $3,125 issued by the Stadacona Water, Light, and Power Company and purporting to be guaranteed by the respondents, the Corporation of the Village of Grand Mere, under the provisions of a Municipal Bye-law No. 10, passed on 15 June 1889. The Appellants sue the Respondents on their guarantee. The Respondents plead (amongst other defences) that the Bye-law in question as well as a contract of 20 June 1899 to give the guarantee were ultra vires and did not bind the Respondents on the ground that the Bye-law had not been approved by the majority in number and value of the municipal electors or authorised by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province. It is admitted that the Bye-law was not even submitted to the electors for their approval or to the Lieutenant-Governor. The only question on this Appeal is whether the approval of the electros and the Lieutenant-Governor or of either of them was necessary the validity of the Bye-law.

The facts, which are not really in dispute, appear to be that the two respondents, Gaynor and Greene, had been in the employment of the Government of the United States of America, and have been charged with certain criminal offences in respect of certain transactions in the State of Georgia. While they were in Quebec application was made to an officer called an Extradition Commissioner for their arrest in pursuance of the international extradition arrangement between Canada and the United States of America.

The Water Commissioners of the City of London and The Corporation of the City of London [1905 UKPC 54] The Appellant is the owner and occupier of lands adjoining the river Thames in the Province of Ontario, and of a water mill operated by water from that river. He complains in this action that the respondents by the erection of a dam with flash boards across the river Thames as a point some miles below the Appellant\u2019s mill have penned back the water in the river, with the result that in certain seasons of the year his lands are flooded, and the water power of his mill is interfered with. There is no serious dispute that the Appellant has in fact been injured by the respondents\u2019 works, and if this were all his right of action would be clear. But the respondents the Water Commissioners, who are incorporated by a Provincial Act, 36 Vict. C. 102 (Ontario), for supplying the City of London with the pure water, contend at their Lordships\u2019 Bar that they are authorised by their Act to execute the works complained of, and the Appellant\u2019s remedy (if any) is to proceed by arbitration for damages under the provisions of the Act.

No rent had been paid and the occupation was open and unchallenged down to some time in 1895. This piece of land, described as a mill site in various conveyances under which it had passed, was and is land belonging to the Crown.

VII., c. 13, Section 13, is, or is not, ultra vires of the Dominion Legislature. In the events which have happened the question has in this instance become more or less an academic one, inasmuch as the two person arrested under the Attorney-General\u2019s warrant granted under the authority of Section 6 were on 17 June 1903 discharged from the custody by order of Mr. Justice Anglin, and a year having therefore elapsed since the date of their entry into Canada they cannot be re-arrested.

The Appellant has brought this action on her own account and as tutrix of Ramsden\u2019s minor children against the respondent Company for damages occasioned to them by the accident. The action was tried by the accident. The action was tired by Mr. Justice Doherty with the assistance of a jury, and by their verdict the jury found (amongst other things) that Ramsden\u2019s death was caused by the fault of the respondent Company and its employes, and that Ramsden did not by his conduct contribute to bring about the said accident.

These provisions against any \"contracting out\" on the part of railway companies within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament fsrom the liability to pay damages for person injury to their servants. It is not disputed that in the partition of duties effected by the British North America Act, 1867 between the Provincial and the Dominion legislatures, the making of laws for through railways is entrusted to the Dominion.

Le Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke [1907 UKPC 22] This Appeal arises out of a transaction which took place in 1901, by which the Appellant sold to the respondents certain gold mining claims, and shares in claims, with other properties in Yukon. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Cabot v. The Attorney General of the Province of Quebec [1907 UKPC 53] In 1898 the Appellant purchased the Seigniory and Fief of Grand River, in the county of Gaspe, as described in the original deeds of concession, made of the said Seigniory by the King of France, and containing about two leagues in front of te whole depth and bounded, in front by the Gulf of St. Lawrence, in rear by the township Rameau on one side towards the west by the Seigniory of Pabos, with all the fishing and hinting and other rights and privileges which the vendor had or might have as Seignior, or along its frontage on the sea shore. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of King's Bench] Dumphy v. The Montreal Light Heat and Power Company [1907 UKPC 49] Although there is a very voluminous record in this case, the facts are of singular simplicity. A building contractor used a derrick in putting up a house in one of the streets of Montreal. His workmen brought the derrick into contact with the overhead wires of the Respondents, with the result that a current of electricity was diverted to the street and killed the husband of the Appellant. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of King's Bench] The Esquimalt Waterworks Company v. The Corporation of the City of Victoria [1907 UKPC 52] This action was brought to restrain the respondents from entering upon certain lands of the Appellants and from posting thereon notices under the Act of British Columbia, intituled \"The Water Clause Consolidation Act, 1897,\" and the substantial question is whether the Respondents can appropriate for the purposes of the municipality certain waters flowing from two different sources, Goldstream River and Niagara Creek, which water the Appellants claim to be theirs under the Esquimalt Waterworks Act, 1885, and the Esquimalt Waterworks Extension Act, 1892. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Overturned [British_Columbia_Court_of_Appeal|British Columbia Supreme Court] McCormick v. Simpson and others [1907 UKPC 50] The question on this Appeal is as to the construction of the will of one James Cooper, who died at Montreal in 1866 possessed of real and personal property. The will was made at Montreal, and is dated 20 August 1863. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of King's Bench] McGregor v. the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Company [1907 UKPC 44] [British_Columbia_Court_of_Appeal|British Columbia Supreme Court] [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Overturned [British_Columbia_Court_of_Appeal|British Columbia Supreme Court] McVity and another v. Tranouth and another [1907 UKPC 65] The only question in this case is which of two innocent parties is to bear the loss occasioned by the fraud of one Sootheran, a dishonest lawyer. One of the parties trusted him as professional adviser; the other dealt at arm\u2019s length with him as an honest man. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Zacklynski and others v.

The Toronto Railway Company [1907 UKPC 17] The question in these Appeals turn upon the construction of the Agreement, confirmed by Statute, regulating the rights of the Appellants and Respondents respectively in regard to the working of a certain street railway in the City of Toronto. Prior to 1 September 1891 the principal Appellants, hereinafter called \"the Corporation,\" had become the wieners of the said railway which they proposed to sell and offered for sale by tender subject to conditions prepared by their Engineer. The tender of one George Kiely and others was accepted, for whom the Respondents in the principal Appeal, hereinafter called \"the Railway Company,\" were substituted on the terms of an agreement which was confirmed by Statute 55 Vict., cap. 99. The railway Company thenceforth have continued to work the railway. Disputes having arisen between the parties as to their rights in relation to the said railway the Corporation in 1903 commenced proceedings to have them determined. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Overturned Partially [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] The Corporation of the City of Toronto v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company [1907 UKPC 58] The question on this Appeal is as to the liability of the Appellants, the Corporation of the City of Toronto, to pay a share of the cost of certain protective measures ordered by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council of Canada for the purpose of safeguarding the public streets at points within or immediately adjoining the city boundary. At two of the crossings the southern boundary of the railway is the northern boundary of the city. In third the crossing is wholly within the city. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] Townsend v. Cox [1907 UKPC 54] These cases come before this Board under the following circumstances:- The Appellant is an hotel-keeper at Kentville, Nova Scotia, where the Canada Temperance Act, 1888, 51 Vict., cap. 34, was all material times in force. On 23 September 1905, in consequence of an information laid before two Justices by the Respondent under that Act, a search warrant was issued to search the said hotel and premises for intoxicating liquor suspected to be kept for sale thereon. On 25 September the search warrant was duly executed and large quantities of intoxicating liquor were found there, and brought before the Justices to be dealt with the law. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Nova_Scotia_Supreme_Court|Nova Scotia Supreme Court] McConnell v. Beatty and another [1907 UKPC 68] The controversy out of which this Appeal arises relates to two parcels of mining land in the district of Algoma, Ontario. In the year 1887 the lands in question were undoubtedly vested in free simple in William H. Beatty. But in that year, the taxes payable upon the lands having faled into arrear, the lands were put up for sale by the proper Government Officer, in order to realise the arrears. A number of properties were sold at about the same time, under similar circumstances, the sales being held on 11 November and 14 December 1887. The lands now in question were sold on the 14h December, and one Thomas H. Bull became the purchaser of these lands and of a large number of other lots. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Overturned [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] The Crown Grain Company Limited The Attorney General for the Province of Manitoba (Intervenient) v. H.L. Day [1908 UKPC 58] [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Fulton v. Norton [1908 UKPC 33] Their Lordships think that a cause of action arose in this case upon the definite refusal of the Defendant (the Appellant), in the letters of 2 May 1906 and 4 May 1906, to submit the Respondent\u2019s Petition of Right to the Lieutenant-Governor. The Statute says that this is to be done, and says nothing as to the advise with which the Petition is to be accompanied, if any advice is tendered. The cause of action involves some damages, if the jury think fit to award them,-not those supposed to ensue from a refusal to submit the Petition, or-if the facts of the case admitted of the point being raised-from the conduct of the Defendant. In the present case there appears no such ground as that last refereed to. The judge will no doubt, advise very great moderation in estimating the damages in this case. However unimportant the omission of the Defendant to discharge his duty may seem, their Lordships do not think that the Court could take upon itself the function of the jury. The damages are not necessarily nominal. Their Lordships will accordingly humbly advise His Majesty to dismiss this Appeal. The Appellant will pay the costs of it. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The King v. McLean [1908 UKPC 34] The question in this Appeal arises on a demurrer. If, on any reasonable construction of the Respondent\u2019s Petition of Right, a cause of action could be proved, the respondent (the Suppliant) would be entitled to succeed. It will be for the learned Judge who hears the case, when the facts have been proved, to decide whether a cause of action has or has not arisen, but it is not for their Lordships to express an opinion beforehand, on the pleadings as they stand. Accordingly their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty to dismiss this Appeal. In accordance with the undertaking given on behalf of the Attorney-general for Canada when special leave to appeal was granted, the Appellant will pay the respondent\u2019s costs of the Appeal as between Solicitor and Client. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Prevost and others v. Prevost and others [1908 UKPC 56] [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] William Jose and others v. The Metallic Roofing Company of Canada Limited [1908 UKPC 50] This litigation arises out of a strike of workmen in the employment of the Plaintiffs (Respondents), and other proceedings following thereupon. The strike is the only matter which their Lordships think it necessary to deal with on this Appeal. The Plaintiffs were manufacturers employing workmen in their business. The Defendants (as the suit was ultimately constituted) were right persons, sued on their own behalf, and on behalf of the members of a local Toronto trade union, and also on behalf of the members of another union of wider scope. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] The Toronto Railway Company v. King and another [1908 UKPC 11] The action out of which this appeal rises was brought by the respondents, the representatives of one David King, deceased, who lost his life in a collision between a delivery van which he was driving, and an electric tramcar belonging to the defendants (the Appellant Company), brought about (as it is alleged) by the negligent management of the tramcar by the servant of the Company employed to drive it. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Sustained [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] Alfred S. Woodruff and others v. The Attorney General for the Province of Ontario [1908 UKPC 57] The question on these Appeals is as to the right of the Attorney-General of the Province of Ontario to demand payment of a tax called in the Provincial Act which imposed it \"succession duty,\" upon personal property locally situate outside the Province and alleged by him to form part of the estate of a deceased domiciled inhabitant of the Province, one Samuel De Veaux Woodruff. This question involves the consideration of two separate transactions, or sets of transactions, whereby the ceased divested himself, or assumed to divest himself, of certain personal property locally situate in the state of New York. The first of these transactions took place in 1894, the second in1902. The deceased died on 28 October 1904, domiciled, as above stated, in the Province of Ontario. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Overturned [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] The Corporation of the City of Toronto v. John Russell [1908 UKPC 49] [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Overturned [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] The King v. Walkmen [1908 UKPC 47] This application touches several very delicate and difficult questions on which their Lordships desire to express no opinion. In any case they would be very slow to interfere, at the instance of a prosecution, with a new trial directed by the Courtof Appeal in favour of the accused; and on that ground they find it impossible to advise His Majesty to grant special leave to appeal in this case. The Petitioner must pay the respondent\u2019s costs of the Petition. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Sustained [British_Columbia_Court_of_Appeal|British Columbia Supreme Court] Mary Watts v. Rubin Watts [1908 UKPC 53] [British_Columbia_Court_of_Appeal|British Columbia Supreme Court] [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Overturned [British_Columbia_Court_of_Appeal|British Columbia Supreme Court] La Compagnie Hydraulique de St. Franpois v. The Continental Heat and Light Company and another [1908 UKPC 59] A Statute, 60 & 61 Vict. C. 72, of the Parliament of Canada incorporated the Respondent Company and enacted that (s.7) it might manufacture, supply, sell, and dispose of gas and electricity, with other powers. Subsequent provincial Statutes of Quebec incorporated the Appellant Company, and granted it the exclusive privilege of producing and selling electricity within a radius of thirty miles from the village of Disraeli, in the Province of Quebec [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of King's Bench] The McArthur Export Company v. J.B. Klock [1908 UKPC 7] When disentangled from a mass of details having no effect on its decision, this case stands out in singular simplicity. It is an action for goods, to wit timber, sold and delivered; and the allegations of the Plaintiffs (now the respondents) are contained in ten lines of print. The sale alleged is by a written contract, produced; and the delivery is said, in the writ, to be detailed in an account produced, this document again being of excellent brevity and precision, covering only five lines of print, but stating all that was necessary, the pieces delivered, their sizes and the price charged. The decree sought is for payment of the price of the wood. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Overturned [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of King's Bench] The Quebec Improvement Company v. The Quebec Bridge and Railway Company [1908 UKPC 4] These are Appeals from the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Lower Canada. The Appellants, the Quebec Improvement Company, were the owners of three lots of piece of land, in the immediate neighbourhood of Quebec, which the Quebec Bridge and Railway Company required for the purposed of their undertaking. The parties were unable to agree as to the price, and the matter was referred to arbitration. The result was an award which the railway Company impeached by an action at law, and the Improvement Company in a separate action sought to enforce. [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of King's Bench] The Commercial Rubber Company Limited v. The Corporation of the Town of St. Jerome [1908 UKPC 35] Fees residing within the municipality, 75 of whom at least were to be heads of families, and to pay at least $65,000 in salaries; to give them respondent, as a guarantee of the execution of its obligations, a first hypothec of $50,000 on its real estate in the municipality; and to begin the works of such construction within three months after the approval of the bye-laws by the municipal electors, the said bonus to be payable as follows, $25,000 as soon as the Company has constructed its factory and installed its machinery and plant, and was in operation, and had executed the above mentioned deed of hypothec for $50,000, and another $25,000 as soon as the Company had in its employ 150 employees of the description above-mentioned. [James_Robertson,_Baron_Robertson|Lord Robertson] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of King's Bench] The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. W.N. Robertson [1909 UKPC 4] The question on this Appeal really is, whether or not Section 3 of the Act of the late Province of Canada of 1853 (16 Victoria cap. 37) is impliedly repealed by the Dominion Railway Act of 1906 (6 Edw. VII. Cap. 42), which is to prevail when the Provincial Act is inconsistent with it.

The Red Mountain Railway Company [1909 UKPC 13] The Plaintiffs (Appellants) are saw-mill owners and timber merchants who own certain property in the neighbourhood of Rossland in the Province of British Columbia.

Brunet and others [1909 UKPC 10] [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of King's Bench] [Edward_Macnaghten,_Baron_Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten] Overturned [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of King's Bench] Bow McLachlin and Company Limited v. The Ship Camosun and the Union steamship Company of British Columbia Limited [1909 UKPC 35] This Appeal raises a question of considerable interest and importance as to the jurisdiction in Admiralty of the Exchequer Court of Canada. The facts giving rise to the case are these:- The Appellants are a shipbuilding company having their office at Paisley, and in 1904 agreed with the Respondent Company (herein-after called the Respondents), whose office is at Vancouver, British Columbia, to build a steamship, afterwards called the \"Camosun\", for $28,000, of which $5,000 was to be paid in cash on delivery, and the balance was to be treated as lent by the Appellants and secured by mortgage.

Robert Henderson Bryce deceased (now represented by his Executor William Henry Johnson) [1909 UKPC 38] The Appellants in this case are the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the owners of the steamship \"Princess Victoria\" which came into collision about or near the Parthia Shoal off Brockton Point near Vancouver at about 2.20 p.m. on 21 July 1906, with the steamer \"Chehalis,\" and in consequence the latter vessel sank, and some of her passengers and crew were drowned.

Daley and Eric search for a source of water, while Nathan designs a method to capture water condensation. In the end, Nathan's method produces about a half-cup of water, while Daley's digging in the leech-infested grass strikes an underground spring, thus solving the water problems. Jackson does not agree on becoming leader, until Melissa talks him into it.

MacHale November19,2005 With the dried food running out, Nathan, Daley, and Lex have to find food in the jungle. Nathan tries to prove himself by climbing up the tree he previously fell from. Meanwhile, Jackson tries to help out by catching fish, with little success. Eric fakes an ankle injury in order to avoid work altogether, and Melissa carries water for him. Jackson finds a series of three messages in his tent that help him to finally catch fish (use a hook, fish in rocky water, use shiny stones). Nathan succeeds at climbing the tree, only to retrieve 6 coconuts. Then, Daley and Lex show him the other fruit they found, which is plentiful (bananas, mangoes, etc.), and Nathan is embarrassed for not listening to them. At the end of the episode, everyone is seen full after eating all the fruit and fish. Eric belches. Taylor belches like a man and she, Melissa, and Eric laugh. Daley tells Nathan that, even though he didn't listen to her, his effort in climbing the coconut palm was very brave. Jackson thanks Lex, whom he thinks left him the notes on how to fish, but Lex looks confused \u2013 and then Lex gives Taylor an earring that he found in the boys' tent, which was part of one of the clues (and identifies Taylor as their source). Taylor winks at Jackson. (Day Three) With the dried food running out, Nathan, Daley, and Lex have to find food in the jungle.

MacHale January21,2006 Nathan and Daley nearly get into a fight with Jackson over building a raft. To try to bring the survivors together, Lex builds an obstacle course and challenges the others to a competition. Lex builds it as a way to celebrate his birthday which Daley completely forgot about. Jackson was glad he was against Nathan and he ended up winning after sprinting. The raft that Jackson was building was actually a distress signal which they send into the water. In the episode Jackson wears converse low tops, but in the novel The Seven, Jackson had two pairs of sandals, one of which started to blister his feet which had him run slower. Nathan uses that to an advantage, but Jackson fought the pain and had Nathan beat until the last run back to the finish line. Jackson told Nathan to get a head start at the end so he would strap off his sandals to be barefoot; while Nathan wore a pair of canvas slip-ons, barefoot Jackson sprinted in his barefeet to the finish line and beat Nathan who was running slower due to his shoes and already tired. Jackson remains barefoot for the rest of the book.(Day Seven) Nathan and Daley nearly get into a fight with Jackson over building a raft.

Has not yet established a track record. Limited size availability. [Silver-oxide_battery|AgZn] 1.86 1.5 0.46 Smaller volume than equivalent Li-ion. Extremely expensive due to silver. Very high energy density. Very high drain capable. For many years considered obsolete due to high silver prices. Cell suffers from oxidation if unused. Reactions are not fully understood. Terminal voltage very stable but suddenly drops to 1.5 volts at 70-80% charge (believed to be due to presence of both argentous and argentic oxide in positive plate \u2013 one is consumed first). Has been used in lieu of primary battery (moon buggy). Is being developed once again as a replacement for Li-ion. [Lithium-ion_battery|Lithium ion] 3.6 0.46 Very expensive. Very high energy density. Not usually available in \"common\" battery sizes. Very common in laptop computers, moderate to high-end digital cameras, camcorders and cellphones. Very low rate of self discharge. Terminal voltage unstable (varies from 4.2 to 3.0 volts during discharge).

Dahlen and Martin pick Tekisha's frozen cheesecake cookie sandwich - the Smoogy - as the show winner and it is announced that it is now available in select A&P stores. Each of the mentors names two winners they are considering as their selection for the finale. For Fields it is Jen and Carlos. For Chiarello it is Latrice and Dominic. And for Cornyn it is Tekisha and Hannah. They end up choosing Jen, Dominic and Tekisha. The finalists present samples of their product at an A&P supermarket, where their product can also be purchased. Customers also fill out a survey form on the products. Jen is eliminated after having the lowest sales. The two remaining contestants then prepare a variation on their recipe (Tekisha does a chocolate version and Dominic a pork version) as a potential follow-on product. They present their products to A&P CEO Sam Martin, as well as Tom Dahlen.

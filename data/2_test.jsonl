The question is one of general importance, since it involves the principle upon which any incorporated Joint Stock Bank or other Company established out of the limits of the Province of New Brunswick, and any person doing business out of such limit, but having a branch or agency in the city of St. John\u2019s, is liable to be assessed under the Acts relating to the levying of rates in the said city.

Mr Justice Torrance, as the Judge of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, Province of Quebec, District of Montreal, on 21 May 1880, decided that the \"Gresham\" was unduly detained for 17 days, and condemned the Defendants in 850l damages, with interest and costs. [Colin_Blackburn,_Baron_Blackburn|Lord Blackburn] Overturned [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] Carter v.

The question, which their Lordships have found to be one of considerable difficulty, depends on the true construction of the two codes of Lower Canada, the Civil Code, more particularly Art. 2274 and Arts. 2613 and 2614, and the Code of Civil Procedures, more particularly Art. 766 and those following it, and Art. 1360.

Murray et al [1883 UKPC 34] Their Lordships are of opinion that this application ought to be refused. This case made by the Petitioners, the Railway Company, is that they were not liable to the Plaintiff Thomas Murray as having employed him to make certain fencing along the line. They allege that the contract was made with a gentleman of the name of Foster, who was not only a servant of the Company, but a contractor with the Company, dealing with them as an independent contractor. The Judge put the question to the jury, whether they were satisfied that the Plaintiff contracted in the belief that he was dealing with the Company, and further put the question to them whether the Company had fostered that belief and dealt with the Plaintiff on the footing that they had contracted with him; and, in the event of the jury coming in the point of fact to the conclusion that both those questions should be answered in the affirmative, he directed them that a verdict should follow for the Plaintiff. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The Attorney General of Ontario v.

By the Imperial Statute 31 Geo. III., cap. 31, Sect. 43, it was provided that all lands which should be thereafter granted, within the Province of Upper Canada (now Ontario), should be granted in free and common soccage, in like manner as lands where then holden in free and common soccage in England. The argument before their Lordships, on both sides, proceeded upon the assumption that the lands now in question were so holden.

At that time the concern was not in a very prosperous condition, and in the month of July 1875, the balance due by the Company in its account current with the Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada was upwards of $17,000. The Appellant was President and Chairman of the Board of Directors; and he had endorsed the Company\u2019s promissory notes, for its accommodation, to the Merchants\u2019\u2019 Bank, to the amount of $65,000.

The she, the \"Bunin,\" kept her course; but that the \"Arklow,\" by some unaccountable mismanagement, as it is state, ran into the \"Bunin,\" striking her about the fore rigging in the starboard side with her stern.

[Colin_Blackburn,_Baron_Blackburn|Lord Blackburn] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Canada Central Railway Company v. McLaren [1884 UKPC 37] The Appellants are the proprietors of a railway which passes through the village of Carlton Place, in the province of Ontario, situated on the north bank of the River Mississippi. The respondent is a timber merchant, and in the course of his business he brings large quantities of wood, in rafts, to Carlton Place, which are there converted into sawn lumber, and, when thoroughly dried, are sent to market along the Appellants\u2019 railway. For many years prior to the origin of the present litigation, the respondent had, with a view to its being conveniently loaded of \"shipped\" in railway cars, for conveyance to market. The piles, which were stacked on both sides of the line, were 17 or 18 feet in height, from a foot to a foot and a half apart, and the face of each pile was not more than six feet distant from the nearest rail used for Appellants ordinary traffic. On 27 May 1879 a fire broke out in one of the piles on the east side of the Appellants\u2019 main line, and, spreading rapidly, destroyed a great quantity of lumber and plant belonging to the Respondent.

Reed [1884 UKPC 44] Their Lordships have considered the argument which they have heard, and they have come to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed. The points to be considered are three; first of all, can this charge upon exhibits used in the Courts of Justice of the province be justified under the 2nd sub-section of clause 92 of direct taxation within the province \"in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes? What is the meaning of the word direct taxation? [John_FitzGerald,_Baron_FitzGerald|Lord Fitzgerald] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Connor v. The Queen [1885 UKPC 36] It appears from the statement of Mr. Jeune, which is concurred in by the Crown, to be very doubtful whether there is any Petitioner at their Lordships\u2019 bar; and it does not appear to be expedient to have a discussion upon this petition until that fact be ascertained. If the fact be as indicated by Mr. Jeune, that may relieve counsel for the Petitioner of a somewhat difficult task. The rule of this Board is not to entertain any appeal in criminal cases unless in very exceptional circumstances. In this case the Petitioner had the advantage of having the objections take to his sentence fully considered and disposed of by a very competent tribunal. Their Lordships have thought it to be their duty to examine very carefully the statements made in the petition, and they also think it right to state that the reason disclosed by that document are no prima facie such as would induce them to grant leave to appeal. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Manitoba_Court_of_Appeal|Manitoba Queen's Bench] The Exchange Bank of Yarmouth v. Blethen [1885 UKPC 7] The action in which the present appeal arises was brought by the Exchange Bank of Yarmouth, the endorsees of two promissory notes, against Mr. Blethen, a prior endorsee. The notes, against Mr. Blehen, a prior endorsee. The notes were made, one by Messrs, Dennis and Doane, the other by Mr. Doane alone, payable to the order of the Defendant. The Defendant endorsed them to a firm of \"Viels and Dennis,\" who endorsed them to the Plaintiffs. [Colin_Blackburn,_Baron_Blackburn|Lord Blackburn] Sustained [Nova_Scotia_Court_of_Appeal|Nova Scotia Supreme Court] Parker v. Kenny [1885 UKPC 39] Their Lordships do not think it necessary to hear Counsel for the Respondents (Defendants in Court below). This is an Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, dated 26 April 1884, dismissing the Appellant\u2019s appeal and affirming the decision of the Equity Judge on the primary hearing. The character in which the Plaintiff sues is as assignee of one Edward Morrison, an insolvent. [John_FitzGerald,_Baron_FitzGerald|Lord Fitzgerald] Sustained [Nova_Scotia_Court_of_Appeal|Nova Scotia Supreme Court] The Colonial Bank v. The Exchange Bank of Yarmouth [1885 UKPC 41] The question in this case is whether the sum of three thousand dollars in dispute was received by the Defendants under such circumstances that they are to be held to have received it to the use of the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs being the Appellants and the Defendants the Respondents in this Appeal. The Plaintiffs have to show that the money was not received by the Defendants to their own use; that there was privity between them; and that the Plaintiffs occupied such a relation to the Defendants that they are entitled to recall the money out of the Defendants\u2019 hands into their own. That the money was received by the Defendants, not to their own use, but by mistake, is a matter not now disputed. For the decision of the other questions it is necessary to state at some little length the material facts of the case. [Robert_Collier,_1st_Baron_Monkswell|Lord Monkswell] Overturned [Nova_Scotia_Court_of_Appeal|Nova Scotia Supreme Court] Exchange Bank of Canada and others v. The Queen [1886 UKPC 8] The sole ultimate question in this case is whether the Crown, being an ordinary creditor of the Bank which has been put in liquidation, is entitled to priority of payment over its other ordinary creditors. That again depends on the question how the two Codes of Lower Canada are to be construed. Their Lordships think it clear, not only that the Crown is bound by the Codes, but that the subject of priorities is exhaustively dealt with by them, so that the Crown can claim no priority except what is allowed by them. If so, the other points which have been elaborately treated both in the colony and here are only of subsidiary importance, though undoubtedly they have a bearing on the construction of the Codes. [John_FitzGerald,_Baron_FitzGerald|Lord Fitzgerald] Overturned [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Peart [1886 UKPC 13] Their Lordships do not think it necessary to call upon the counsel for the Respondents. It is not necessary at all for their Lordships to express any opinion further than on the question whether the verdict was against the weight of evidence. Of course if there was no evidence at all there should be a non-suit. Their Lordships will not attempt to define, when on a question of contributory negligence, it is within the province of the Judge to non-suit, and they do not think it would be right to discuss it further; for if there was evidence here at all to go to the jury upon the important issues in the case, and that evidence was such as to make the verdict found for the Plaintiff not against the weight of evidence, if follows of course that this was not a case in which the Judge should have taken upon himself to have directed a non-suit. [Colin_Blackburn,_Baron_Blackburn|Lord Blackburn] Sustained [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. Gregory [1886 UKPC 28] [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] [Colin_Blackburn,_Baron_Blackburn|Lord Blackburn] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Lewin and another v. Wilson and others [1886 UKPC 31] On 27 September 1850 John Howe and James White gave a joint and several bond to secure the payment of 1,000l to Margaret Cunningham on 27 September 1855, with interest quarterly until payment of the principal. As between Howe and White the latter was a surety, but they were both principal debtors to the obligee. One the same day each of them mortgaged some property to the oblige to secure the bond debt. White\u2019s mortgage is made upon the express condition that if he and Howe or either of them their or either of their heirs executors or administrators shall pay to Miss Cunningham or her representatives the sum of 1000l on 27 September 1855, with the interest in the meantime according to the conditions of the bond of even date, the mortgage deed is to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company v. The Queen and Western Counties Railway Company [1886 UKPC 30] The Government of Canada, by an agreement dated 22 September 1871, undertook to give the Appellant Company the exclusive use of the Windsor Branch railway, and also running powers over the trunk line, from Windsor Junction to Halifax, for the term of 21 years, from 1 January 1872. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Mary Elizabeth Allen and John Henry Allen v. The Quebec Warehouse Company [1886 UKPC 48] This is an appeal by Mary Elizabeth Allen and John Henry Allen, her husband, Plaintiffs in an action brought by them against the Quebec Warehouse Company, to recover damages for an injury sustained by a ship belonging to the female Plaintiff in the month of November 1880. The action was brought in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, and the Judge of first instance dismissed the action. The Plaintiffs then appealed to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of the province and that Court affirmed the judgement of the Court of first instance. The present Respondents, who were the Defendants in that action, themselves brought an action against the present Appellants to recover damages for the injury which their quay and appliances had sustained owing to the same disaster, which action was likewise dismissed in both Courts. [John_FitzGerald,_Baron_FitzGerald|Lord Fitzgerald] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] Octave Chavigny de la Chevrotiere v. La Cite de Montreal [1886 UKPC 47] The action from which this appeal arises was commenced in the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, Lower Canada. The demandant, who is also the Appellant, claimed to be proprietor of about seven-eights of that part of the city of Montreal which from 1803 to January 1847 had been a public market, and from January 1847 to the present time has been an open public place in the city, known as the Place Jacques Cartier. The demanddent claimed against the Respondents, the city of Montreal, a right to resume possession of that piece of land as in the original ownership of the grantors. His money claim against the city amounted to 180,866 dollars. Further, he claimed that the original deed of grant of 29 December 1813 should be brought in and declared null and void. The claim is said to have arisen under that deed so often referred to in the course of the case. [John_FitzGerald,_Baron_FitzGerald|Lord Fitzgerald] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] The Owners of the Thomas Allen v. Gow and other [1886 UKPC 51] This is an appeal from a decision of the Judge of the Vice Admiralty Court, at Halifax, Nova Scotia, in an action for salvage, on the ground that the sum awarded by the learned Judge is excessive. [Farrer_Herschell,_1st_Baron_Herschell|Lord Herschell] Sustained Vice Admiralty Court, Nova Scotia The Bank of Montreal v. Sweeny [1887 UKPC 25] Their Lordships consider it to be proved in this case that Rose held the disputed shares upon a trust not disclosed by the entry in the Company\u2019s books; that he transferred them to the Bank in breach of his trust; that at the time of the transfer the Bank knew of Rose\u2019s position; and that the Plaintiff turns out to be the person in whose favour the trust existed. It has been argued for the Appellants that these things are not proved, because they require a written commencement de prevue, and have not got it. But on this point their Lordships stopped the Respondent\u2019s Counsel. They are quite clear that if a written commencement is needed, it is to be found in the letters of Crawford and Lockhart couple with the books of the Rolling Mills Company, and in the transfer executed by Rose to Buchanan on 3 June 1876. [Arthur_Hobhouse,_1st_Baron_Hobhouse|Lord Hobhouse] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Dumounlin v. Langtry [1887 UKPC 24] [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Corporation of Parkdale v. West and others [1887 UKPC 41] The facts in these consolidated appeals are few, and not in dispute. Parkdale is the western suburb of Toronto, and a separate Municipality. The boundary between the two Municipalities is Dufferin Street, which runs north and south, and intersects at right angles a public highway called Queen Street, 66 feet wide, and one of the leading thoroughfares connecting Toronto with Parkdale. The Respondents are the owners and occupiers of property fronting Queen Street, near the point of intersection, the property in the one case being in Toronto, in the other in Parkdale. At the date of the commencement of the operation which led to this litigation, Queen Street was crossed on the level at the point of its intersection with Dufferin Street by the main lines of four Railway Companies. [Arthur_Hobhouse,_1st_Baron_Hobhouse|Lord Hobhouse] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The Merchant's Bank of Canada v. Lambe [1887 UKPC 30] These appeals raise one of the many difficult questions which have come up for judicial decision under those provisions of the British North America Act 1867 which apportion legislative powers between the Parliament of the Dominion and the Legislatures of the Provinces. It is undoubtedly a case of great constitutional importance, as the Appellants\u2019 Counsel have earnestly impressed upon their Lirdships. But questions of this class have been left for the decision of the ordinary courts of law, who must treat the provisions of the Act in question by the same methods of constriction and exposition which they apply to other statutes. A number of incorporated Companies are resisting payment of a tax imposed by the Legislature of Quebec, and four of them are the present Appellants. It will be convenient first to deal with the case of the Bank of Toronto, which was argued first. [Arthur_Hobhouse,_1st_Baron_Hobhouse|Lord Hobhouse] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] The North-West Transportation Company and James Hughes Beatty v. Henry Beatty and others [1887 UKPC 39] The action, in which this appeal has been brought, was commenced, on 31 May 1883, in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice of Ontario. The Plaintiff, Henry Beatty, is a shareholder in the North-West Transportation Company, Limited, and he sues on behalf of himself and all other shareholders in the Company, except those who are Defendants. The Defendants are the Company and five shareholders, who, at the commencement of the action were the Directors of the Company. The claim in the action is to set aside a sale made to the Company by James Hughes Beatty, one of the Directors, or a steamer called the \"United Empire\", of which previously to such sale he was sole owner. [Arthur_Hobhouse,_1st_Baron_Hobhouse|Lord Hobhouse] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Cossman v. West and British North America Assurance Company [1887 UKPC 43] There are consolidate appeals from two judgements of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in actions in which the Appellant was the Plaintiff. The action against West was upon a time policy of insurance of the Ocean Marine Assurance Association, dated 28 November 1881, for $4,000, upon the barque \"L.E. Cann,\" a British ship valued at $10,000, from 28 November 1881 to 28 November 1882. The perils insured against were, amongst others, perils of the sears, barratry of the master (unless in case of loss on goods or specie when the master is the consignee or supercargo thereof), and of mariners, and all other perils, losses, or misfortunes that should come to the hurt, detriment, or damage of the said vessel, or any part thereof, subject to the condition and provisions contained in or referred to by clauses in the policy, none of which affect the present case. It was stipulation that no particular average or partial loss, unless in case of general average, was to be paid unless the same should amount to five percent., &c. The policy was underwritten for $100, by West, the Defendant in the suit, who was a member of the Ocean Marine Insurance Association, and is the Respondent in the first appeal. [George_Bramwell,_1st_Baron_Bramwell|Lord Bramwell] Overturned [Nova_Scotia_Court_of_Appeal|Nova Scotia Supreme Court] Allan and others v. Pratt [1888 UKPC 47] Their Lordships are of opinion that the appeal is incompetent. The proper measure of value for determining the question of the right of appeal is, in their judgement, the amount which has been recovered by the Plaintiff in the action and against which the appeal could be brought. Their Lordships, even if they were not bound by it, would agree in principle with the rule laid down in the judgement of this tribunal delivered by Lord Chelmsford in the case of Macfarlan v. Leclaire (15 Moore, P.C.C. 181), that is, that the judgement is to be looked at as it affects the interests of the part who is prejudiced by it, and who seeks to relieve himself from it by appeal. If there is to be a limit of value at all that seems evidently the right principle on which to measure it. The person against whom the judgement is passes has either lost what he demanded as Plaintiff or has been adjudged to pay something or to do something as Defendant. It may be that the value to the Defendant of an adverse judgement is greater than the value laid by the Plaintiff in his claim. [Roundell_Palmer,_1st_Earl_of_Selborne|The Earl of Selborne] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] Dunn and others v. Lareau [1888 UKPC 44] The subject of controversy in this appeal is a parcel of land forming part of the 8th concession of the Seigniorie de Monnoir, which consists of a strip of ground of uniform breadth lying north and south. It was originally laid off in 36 lots bounded by parallel lines running east and west numbered consecutively from 92, the north most to 126 the south most lot. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] Kennedy v. Purcell [1888 UKPC 42] This petition gives rise to a question of considerable importance. The decision complained of has been made under the provisions of the Canadian Controverted Elections Acts; and it will be convenient to refer briefly to those provisions of the Acts on which the judgement of their Lordships is mainly rested. [Arthur_Hobhouse,_1st_Baron_Hobhouse|Lord Hobhouse] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Jennings [1888 UKPC 54] This appeal is taken in an action brought by the Respondent in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Ontario, for damages in respect of the death of her husband, the late William Jennings; her right to recover being founded upon cap. 135 of the Consolidated Statutes of Ontario, secs. 2 and 3, which are expressed in substantially the same terms with the first and second sections of the English Statute, 9 & 10 Vict. C. 93, commonly known as Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. The deceased, who was a healthy man, 41 years of age, lost his life on 10 August 1885, through the negligence of the Appellants\u2019 servants. [Roundell_Palmer,_1st_Earl_of_Selborne|The Earl of Selborne] Sustained [Court_of_Appeal_for_Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal] Redfield Farwell and McIntyre v. The Corporation of Wickham [1888 UKPC 13] The Respondent Corporation became subscribers for stock in the Richleieu, Drummond, and Arthabaska Counties Railway Company, which was incorporated by the Quebec Act, 32 Vict., c. 56, under an agreement by which the Company undertook to construct their line of railway so that it should pass through the municipality of the township of Wickham. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] Rolland v. Cassidy [1888 UKPC 34] Their Lordships do not think it necessary in this case to call upon the Counsel for the Respondents. The question arises under a reference to arbitration of the accounts of a partnership constituted in the year 1874, for the purpose of certain speculation in lumber of which either the whole or a considerable part had been previously bought by the co-partners. [Roundell_Palmer,_1st_Earl_of_Selborne|The Earl of Selborne] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] Singleton Dann and Company v. Knight and others [1888 UKPC 50] This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec, Appeal side, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court by which the action of the Plaintiffs, the now Appellants, was dismissed with costs. There are therefore two concurrent judgments upon the question at issue between the parties. [Roundell_Palmer,_1st_Earl_of_Selborne|The Earl of Selborne] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] [St_Catherines_Milling_and_Lumber_Co_v_R|St. Catherines Milling v. The Queen] [1888 UKPC 70] On 3 October 1873, a formal Treaty, or contract, was concluded between Commissioners appointed by the Government of the Dominion of Canada on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen of the one part, and a number of Chiefs and Headmen duly chosen to represent the Salteaux tribe of Ojibbeway Indians, of the other part, by which the latter, for certain considerations, released and surrendered to the Government of the Dominion, for Her Majesty and her successors, the whole right and title of the Indian inhabitants whom they represented, to a tract of country upwards of fifty thousand square miles in extent. [Roundell_Palmer,_1st_Earl_of_Selborne|The Earl of Selborne] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The Attorney General of British Columbia v. The Attorney General of Canada [1889 UKPC 13] The question involved in this appeal is one of considerable interest to the parties, but it will be found to lie within a very narrow compass, when the facts, as to which there is no dispute, are explained. By an Order in Council, dated 16 May 1871, Her Majesty, in pursuance of the enactments of Section 146 of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" was pleased to ordain that the Province of British Columbia should, from the 29th day of July following, be admitted into and form part of the Dominion of Canada subject to the provisions of that Act and to certain Articles of Union which had been duly sanctioned by the Parliaments of Canada and by the Legislature of British Columbia. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Overturned [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Robert McMillan v. The Grand trunk Railway Company of Canada [1889 UKPC 27] With regard to applications like the present, the following rules were laid down by this Board in the case of Prince v. Gagnon (8 Appeal Cases, 103), \"Their Lordships are not prepared to advise Her Majesty to exercise her prerogative be admitting an appeal to Her Majesty in Council from the Supreme Court of the Dominion, save where the case is of gravity, involving matter of public interest, or some important question of law, or affecting property of considerable amount, or where the case is otherwise of some public importance of a very substantial character.\" This case admittedly does not affect property of considerable amount, nor can it well be described as being of a very substantial character, because after giving credit for the sum already paid by the Canadian Pacific Railway on account of the Petitioner\u2019s claims, the sum at stake is reduced to something under 250 l sterling. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The Corporation of the Town of St. John and another v. The Central Vermont Railway Company [1889 UKPC 43] By the Quebec Act, 44 Vict., cap. 62, which amends and consolidates previous statutes relating to the incorporation of the town of St. John\u2019s, Appellant Corporation is (Section 86) authorized to levy annually on all lands, town lots, and parts of town lots within the municipality, with the buildings and erections thereon, a sum not exceeding one half cent in the dollar on their whole real value as entered on the assessment roll of the town. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] La Cite de Montral v. Les Ecclesiasitiques du Seminaire de St. Sulpice [1889 UKPC 35] By the Quebec Act, 44 Vict., cap. 62, which amends and consolidates previous statutes relating to the incorporation of the town of St. John\u2019s, Appellant Corporation is (Section 86) authorized to levy annually on all lands, town lots, and parts of town lots within the municipality, with the buildings and erections thereon, a sum not exceeding one half cent in the dollar on their whole real value as entered on the assessment roll of the town. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Susan McMullan alias Millen v. Dame Jane Wadsworth [1889 UKPC 50] The question to be determined in this case is whether James Wadsworth, by his marriage in September 1828 with Margaret Quigley, widow of James McMullen, subjected himself to the legal community of property as then established in Lower Canada. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] The North Shore Railway Company v. Pion and others [1889 UKPC 52] The Appellants in this case are a Canadian Railway Company, against whom an action was brought by the Respondents, tanners at Quebec, in October 1883. The Respondents carried on their business upon riparian land belonging to them, which had a frontage of considerable length to the St. Charles, a tidal navigable river within the limits of the Harbour of Quebec. [Roundell_Palmer,_1st_Earl_of_Selborne|The Earl of Selborne] Sustained [Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme Court of Canada] Senecal v. Pauze [1889 UKPC 49] In this case their Lordships are of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench ought to be affirmed. It appears that, on 31 January 1880, one Pangman deposited with Senecal 54 debentures of the Laurentian Railway Company of the nominal value of $500 each as collateral security for the payment of two promissory notes of the same date of $1000 each, payable the one 10 months and the other 12 months after date. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] McDougall v. McGreevy [1889 UKPC 40] The Respondent McGreevy being the owner of one thousand $100 shares in the North Shore Railway Company, and being unable to pay a call of 50 per cent. which had been made upon them on 14 September 1882, transferred them to the Appellant, who was also a shareholder in the Company, and took from him a letter of that date, in which it was stated that the transfer had been made with the express condition that McGreevy would have the right to redeem the stock within two months from that date by paying 50 per cent. of the nominal amount of the shares, that is to say, fifty thousand dollars, and any further call on the same that might be paid \"within said delay,\" with interest on such amount. [William_Watson,_Baron_Watson|Lord Watson] Overturned [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] Gilmour and others v. Mauroit [1889 UKPC 47] In this case the Superior Court issued an order enjoining the Defendants, who are the now Appellants, to discontinue and cease all lumbering and other works in connection there-with on certain lots of land in the possession of the Complainant, who is now Respondent. [Arthur_Hobhouse,_1st_Baron_Hobhouse|Lord Hobhouse] Sustained [Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|Quebec Court of Queen's Bench] Gilmour and others v.
